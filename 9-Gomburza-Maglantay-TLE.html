<h1> THIS IS ME </h1>

<p> My name is Eros Troy, but just called me Eros or Troy. We are four siblings and I’m the youngest in the family. Our names started at ER, because my fathers name is Erwin and my mother is Rosalie. I am 14 years, I was born on 23rd of May in 2010, in Manila. </p>

<p> There are a lot of things I like and I don’t like. I like to have fun with my friends, I like to play ML and to play our dogs. I love and I can eat any food, even fresh carrots, cucumber and tomato. But I really love was to go in different places with my family and with my friends. Every year we go in different places with my family, my lola, titas, titos and my cousins. My elder sister rent private resort so we can enjoy our vacation and we can do anything we want. We make sure we do unforgettable memories with my family and extended family. I don’t like when we back to the reality that I and my cousin go home and we see in the next year. And the most I hate is being bored </p>

<p> I was 3 years old when I first attending my school in the barangay Daycare Center, my mother enrolled me because all of my siblings are in the school. I thought going to school was like playground that only you can do was playing. But years later I realized going to school where you can also gain more knowledge and friends. I also learned that going to school make you experienced and encountered a lot of things. I started making memories with my friends, teachers and classmates, I have the best memories and unforgettable moment with them. I just found my self that I love going to school everyday even it makes me tired. I do have a lot of dreams in life and I start working of it because I really want to make my dreams comes true. </p>
